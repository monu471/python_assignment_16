    "\n",
    "Improved performance: Compiling a regular expression into a regex object allows for faster matching and searching operations. The compilation process optimizes the regular expression pattern, resulting in more efficient execution when applied to multiple strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Code readability and reusability: By compiling a regular expression object, you can assign it to a variable and reuse it multiple times in your code. This improves code readability by giving the regular expression a descriptive name and makes it easier to maintain and modify.\n",
    "\n",
    "Predefined flags and options: When compiling a regular expression object, you can specify flags and options that affect how the pattern is interpreted and matched. These flags can include case-insensitive matching, multiline matching, and more. Specifying the flags during compilation allows you to avoid repetitively specifying them in every matching operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Error handling: Compiling a regular expression object allows you to catch and handle any syntax errors in the pattern during the compilation phase. This helps in detecting and resolving errors early in the development process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Separation of concerns: Compiling a regular expression object separates the compilation step from the matching or searching step. This can be useful when you have a complex regular expression pattern that you want to compile once and then use it multiple times with different input strings."

It allows you to specify multiple alternatives within a regular expression pattern. For example, the pattern \"cat|dog\" matches either \"cat\" or \"dog\". It can be used to create a pattern that matches any one of the alternatives provided. The vertical bar separates the alternatives, and the pattern will match if any of the alternatives are found.\n",

    "Square brackets [] as a character set: Square brackets define a character set, also known as a character class. They allow you to specify a set of characters, and the pattern will match any single character that is contained within the set. For example, the pattern \"[aeiou]\" matches any lowercase vowel character. It can be used to create a pattern that matches any single character from a specified set. Square brackets provide a way to define a range of characters or a list of individual characters to be matched.\n",

    "\n",
    "When using the raw-string indicator (r) in regular expression search patterns, it ensures that backslashes (\\) are treated as literal characters rather than escape sequences. Regular expressions often include backslashes to represent special characters or to escape certain characters. By using the raw-string indicator, backslashes are preserved as is, reducing the need for excessive escaping and improving the readability of the pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider the regular expression pattern to match a backslash followed by a digit: r\"\\\\[0-9]\". Without the raw-string indicator, the pattern would be \"\\\\[0-9]\", requiring an extra level of escaping for the backslash.\n",
    "\n",
    "In replacement strings, however, the raw-string indicator is not necessary because backslashes do not have any special meaning. Replacement strings typically use backreferences (e.g., \\1, \\2) to refer to captured groups in the regular expression pattern. Since backslashes in replacement strings are not interpreted as escape sequences, there is no need to use the raw-string indicator.\n",
